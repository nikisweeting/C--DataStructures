# Homework Submissions for CS 163 (C++ & Data Structures)

### Usage:

You can compile and run each assignment with the following command:  

```bash
/usr/bin/g++ AssignmentName.cpp -o main && ./main
```

### Info:

These are my homework submissions for my senior year compsci class (CS163) at Sunset High School.  
  
Included in the Experiments folder are some of my personal experiments into more advanced C++ techniques, such as
runtime arbitrary assembly execution, and travelling salesman solver algorithms.

I hate doing things the standard way where each assignment is split into lots of tiny header and source files, doing that is
freaking ridiculous if the whole assignment is <300 lines.  F the system, forget separate header files, put it all in one nicely commented file
and you save everybody time.

---------------------------------------------------------
These assignments were compiled and tested using:  
`Apple LLVM version 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.72)`  
`Target: x86_64-apple-darwin15.0.0`

Please don't copy this code to cheat on your homework without at least reading it, and interpreting the logic to be your own.  It's hard to refactor a program without understanding how it works, and you will gain a lot by spending the extra 10 minutes to understand it.
